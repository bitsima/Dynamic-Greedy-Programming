Algorithms lab second assignment, 20.04.2023

In this assignment, we were given a dataset consisting of different tasks on different intervals and weights. Main objective of the assignment was to create the most suitable task set according to the chosen criteria.
We've done this with two different approaches, namely dynamic and greedy. 

Dynamic approach required us to choose all the compatible tasks with the maximum weight reached in total, efficiently. While the greedy approach to the problem was to select the most tasks, only caring about compability.
